Creating scripts and coding has always helped me automate my tasks, enabling me to take on new responsibilities. During one of my previous experiences, I noticed a significant lack of IT knowledge at the management level, which impacted team performance and productivity. In a spirit of improvement, I decided to deepen my knowledge by enrolling in a development school. As my skills and understanding of low-level programming grew, I became passionate and decided to pursue a career as a full-time software engineer.

I have keen interest for compiler and languages and would love to work more closely on those subject in the near futur.
